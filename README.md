Description: "Cantonese pop music is the subgenre of Chinese pop music (C-pop), which has been quite popular in China and other resions where people also speack Cantonese such as Singapore. Musically, it is problematic to define Cantopop because of its various musical styles and influences (Alice, 2010) by international genres such as Western pop music, Jazz, disco and others. /n
  I would like find out if the style of Cantonese pop music has changed over the 20 years. The corpurs consists of songs in the list of  Top 10 Gold Song by RTHK radio in HongKong from 2000 to 2020.  There are some researh questions to address the objective of this project: 1) What are the most poppular and least popual songs? 2) Do composers use the similar tempo between 2000s and 2010s? 3) Is there differnece in mood features of Cantonese music between 2000s and 2010s?
